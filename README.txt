PROJECT TITLE: 
Sorting Algorithms Benchmarking Application


INTRODUCTION:
Java application created as a part of a project around sorting algorithms to analyse the speed of a selection of algorithms with random, increasing inputs. The results of each run of random sets of data was output into a formatted table. I used these results for a separate report discussing the algorithms in detail and how the empirical findings stood against theoretical classification.

SORTING ALGORITHMS:
- Bubble Sort
- Counting Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

FURTHER DETAIL:
The application creates 10 random unsorted arrays of varying sizes for each sorting algorithm to sort and then takes the average time. It does with with each array over an increasing ranges, demonstrating the divergence in efficacy in sorting for each algorithm as the amount to be sorted increases.


EXECUTION:
The java files in the SRC folder may be imported to an IDE. There, the application can be executed by running the Runner class.
